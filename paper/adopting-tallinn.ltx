\section*{Introduction}
Recent years have witnessed a shift of the earth's battlefield. For better or
worse, militaries can largely trade in their guns for laptops and their soldiers
for hackers. The nations of the world are connecting critical services and
infrastructure to cyberspace, and doing so with minimal technical or legal
protections in place. This puts them at great risk of attack. The
offensive capabilities and risks are continually increasing in cyberspace, so
too must the protections.

In the wake of the Second World War, the international community recognized the
necessity of establishing agreements and rules for international conflict.
The United Nations was organized in 1942
and the Geneva Conventions in 1949.\footnote{\cite{unitedNationsHistory}}
 \footnote{\cite{genevaConventionsOrigins}}
These organizations founded treaties that defined international laws for entering
into conflict (\textit{jus ad bellum}) and behavior during conflict
(\textit{jus in bello}), respectively. To this day, those laws protect
states from unwarranted kinetic attack and offer aid and support when the laws
are broken and a nation is victimized.

The agreements by these groups were established a full half century before the
public internet was in its infancy, and as such, the laws consider only kinetic
warfare. The growing prevalence of cyber operations is pushing the
boundaries of what might be considered harmful or forceful behavior, and the
international community has little means to deal with such events. Cyber
operations rarely have a direct or obvious kinetic
counterpart for comparison, and without established guidelines, states
continue to progress their offensive cyber arms race. Cyber operations are
limited only by technical capabilities rather than legal or ethical standards.

The Tallinn Manual was created to fill this void in international law
by translating the established, kinetic laws to this modern, cyber
battlefield.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See page 18, paragraph 2.} The need
for such a set of laws grows more apparent with each passing year.

The goal of this report is to examine whether the Tallinn Manual is
suitable for official adoption by the international community. To make this
determination, its applicability to real life actions, particularly the Stuxnet
worm, will be considered, as well as the Tallinn Manual's political hurdles. If
successful, the Tallinn Manual's official adoption could help to ensure the
safety and security of all states in coming years.

\section*{The Current Situation}
Today, 193 of 196 countries of the world are members of the United Nations.
%TODO have 193 agreed to the charter??
These countries enjoy agreements protecting their sovereignty and freedom from
unsolicited acts of physical aggression. These laws do not explicitly exclude
cyber acts of aggression, but the nature of international law is permissive--if
an act isn't explicitly stated illegal, then it's considered
legal.\footnote{\cite{lotusSummary}} Since there are no laws established for
cyber operations and little or no correlation to kinetic laws, there can be no
repercussion from the international community.

Differing interpretations of how established laws regulate cyber activity
results in dissension among states and incompatible policies. For example, there
are no accepted answers on what constitutes illegal activity, whether it's even
possible to exert a use of force or launch an armed attack online, or what
repercussions would be appropriate if it is
possible.\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}, 431-435.}

With no consensus on what constitutes permissible cyber activity, there can be
no agreement on suitable international laws or treaties to govern behavior. By
extension, there are also no means to reprimand states or enforce acceptable
behavior in cyberspace.

% Is the Tallinn Manual used unofficially anywhere?

\section*{Why This Needs to Change}
The world's situation is only growing more dire as states become more
reliant on cyberspace. The worlds' critical infrastructure, including power
grids, water treatment plants, financial institutions and health care equipment,
is growing increasingly more connected or reliant on the Internet. Citizens and
governments rely on these services to maintain a healthy and safe standard of
living. This infrastructure, and by extension the cyberspace that
enables its proper operation, has a direct effect on a state's sovereignty and
deserves the same protections the physical world is granted.

The new realm of cyberspace provides a battleground the states of the world are
just beginning to explore. New attacks are constantly developed and far outpace
states' abilities to defend against them.

In 2007, Estonia chose to relocate a bronze statue of a Soviet soldier to
quell the dispute between Estonian nationalists, who saw the statue as a symbol
of oppression, and a Russian ethnic group, who considered its take down
offensive. Following the statue's move, Russia initiated perhaps the largest
distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack seen to date. Estonia is one of the
most cyber connected nations in the world, and the attack disabled banking, news
websites, the government's online services, telephony and credit card
verification systems. Estonia's communications and commerce were rendered
effectively useless for weeks.\footnote{\cite{clarkeCyberWar}, 12-16.}

The events in Estonia demonstrate the capabilities of even simple cyber attacks,
and the serious repercussions against states connected as
Estonia prove the concern is significant.\footnote{\cite{clarkeCyberWar},
  13. In at least 2007, Estonia ranked ahead of even the United States with
  regards to Internet use for every day tasks.} It's crucial that the
international community establish rules protecting states' cyberspace.

\section*{The Tallinn Manual}
The Tallinn Manual was an effort to fill the void in international law when it
comes to cyberspace. It was the effort of an international group of legal
experts, upon encouragement from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
to correlate existing international laws on conflict to
cyberspace.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, 16, para. 1.} The intent
was to give meaning to the laws established by the United Nations and Geneva
Conventions in cyberspace.

Over a period of three years, legal experts from many NATO states discussed the
complications of cyber operations and how to apply the established laws to this
new dimension with a clarity unachieved by any other attempts. The result is a
set of 25 Rules and many additional thoughts, issues and sticking points, in the
form of commentary throughout the document.

The effort concluded in 2012 and continues to stand alone in its thoroughness
considering a modern world and outpaced laws.

\section*{The Stuxnet Worm}
Stuxnet was a revolutionary cyber attack in 2010 that sabotaged the programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) at Iran's Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. The
intent was to delay Iran's potential development of
nuclear weapons, and it did this by causing the centrifuges that spin uranium
to spin out of control and ultimately destroy
themselves.\footnote{\cite{symantecStuxnetOverview}} \footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}}

% TODO could add more detail here

Despite the destructive chaos actually happening in the system, all the while
the hardware would deliver positive reports to the operators, assuring them that
operation was going safely and as planned, so the human operators capable of
intervening had no indication there was an issue, much less one so dire.

To consider Stuxnet an act of aggression by another nation it has to be
known that it was in fact the product of a nation and not a private group of
citizens or hacktivists. Stuxnet's level of technical difficulty was uncontested
by any cyber attack prior (and maybe since). Stuxnet was not only extremely
complex, it was also highly expensive.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetCostComplexity}}
This evidence supports the theory that the attack was orchestrated by a
nation-state, which qualifies it as a politically motivated operation. More
recently, more concrete evidence has surfaced that it was in fact executed by a
nation-state, particularly a collaboration between the United States and
Israel.\footnote{\cite{snowdenStuxnetAuthor}}

Stuxnet exists amidst many controversial cyber operations over the past decade,
yet it still deserves much focus when considering cyber operations and
international law on armed conflict, because it offers, arguably, the
most likely candidate of a cyber-only
operation to be considered a use of force or an armed attack. Prime alternative
operations include Flame Malware and Russia's cyber attack on
Georgia.\footnote{\cite{flameForbes}} \footnote{\cite{russiaAttackGeorgiaAC}}
Flame was used for only espionage, and that is generally considered legal under
international law.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 6, comment 4.} Russia's
cyber attack on Georgia in 2008, conversely, was used to further a kinetic
attack and falls clearly into the category of an armed
attack.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 94, para 6
  and \cite{tallinnManual}, rule 20.} These operations raise many interesting
questions of their own, but the overall conclusions are unsurprising and generally
uncontroversial.

The enrichment facility at Natanz was not connected to the Internet. Despite
these precautions taken against cyber attack, it proved to still be
vulnerable. This further supports the need for agreements on behavior because it
demonstrates how difficult it is to guard against the incredible offensive
capabilities being developed. Stuxnet was likely initially introduced to the target
environment by an infected USB drive.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetMicroscope}, 8.} En
route to its final target, the virus crossed an unknown number of state
boundaries.

The damage was intended to stifle development of military operations by damaging
Iran's ability to enrich uranium. The precise effects are unknown, as Iran
refused to comment on whether it suffered damage from Stuxnet. However, it's
widely held that their nuclear program did suffer significant setbacks, on the
order of what could have been accomplished with a kinetic
attack.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetIsis}}

As is with many worms, and almost by their very design, Stuxnet proved difficult
to control. It leaked into the wild and infected an untold number of civilian
computers in more than a dozen
countries.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetMicroscope}, 15.} Eugene Kapersky,
founder of the Russian security company Kapersky Labs, claimed the virus even
infected the Russian nuclear facilities. He is not alone in these claims,
either, with as many as 15 other industrial complexes around the world
believed to have been infected by Stuxnet.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetPlants}}

The distinction here between civilian and nuclear or industrial facility
infection is significant, not only due to concerns
regarding civilian targeting, but because of the nature of Stuxnet itself.
Stuxnet was designed to recognize the hardware on which it was running, and if
it wasn't on specific Siemen's PLCs it would sit
dormant.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetPlants}}
Infected civilians would not only be unaware, they would be at no risk of danger
whatsoever. The infected industrial facilities, however, would likely suffer
grave damage, just as Iran's facility is believed to have experienced at
Natanz.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetIsis}}

\section*{Where Traditional Law is Not Enough}
Cyber operations like Stuxnet are unlike any with which the world has yet dealt.
The executions of these attacks raise many questions where guidance from a
suitable guide is desired to determine which laws, if any, were broken, how
severely they were broken, and what response might be warranted. There are a
handful of major issues raised by Stuxnet which warrant specific consideration:

\begin{enumerate}
  % TODO probably don't double space this
  % TODO add more detail
  \item Was it was a use of force?
  \item Was it was an armed attack?
  \item Did it lack sufficient direction and discrimination?
  \item Who can be held accountable in such an event?
  \item If laws were broken, what retaliation is appropriate?
\end{enumerate}

These complications will be considered here.

\subsection*{Use of Force}
At perhaps the most fundamental, it is not clear whether Stuxnet was illegal under
international law. To determine its legality there would need to be consensus
that it did violate a law or laws already in place. One of the foremost laws
would be that prohibiting a use of force, set forth by Article 2(4) of the
United Nations Charter. It states:

\begin{quote}
  All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or
  use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of
  any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United
  Nations.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 11.}
\end{quote}

Regarding only kinetic law, Stuxnet's classification as a use of force is not
clear, however. Though the distinction is not defined in the Charter, the
traditional notion of force requires military force and violence, whereas
Stuxnet, and nearly all cyber attacks, did not even include a physical presence,
much less kinetic force.

\subsection*{Armed Attack}
Some states have adopted a generally all-encompassing definition of what constitutes
an illegal use of kinetic force, while others operate with much narrower
classifications that limit a use of force to be effectively the same as an armed
attack.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 17, para 3.} Supposing the
international community accepts the view that a cyber attack does coincide a
use of force, this issue is the same as that of a use of force, but any consensus
for a further definition of the term is unlikely.

Some popular definitions of an armed attack require it to be violent, political,
and (TODO cite. this definition was in our reading one week). There have been no
cyber-only attacks to date that fit this description, so is it even possible to
launch an armed attack online? How might an armed cyber attack be quantified?

\subsection*{Discriminate Attack}
The Stuxnet worm leaked into the wild and infected civilian and government
devices. A failure to control weapons in kinetic warfare is outlawed as
indiscriminate, but it's not certain the same applies to
malware.\footnote{\cite{genevaArticle51}} With malware there is little danger of
harm relative to illegal kinetic attacks, such as chemical warfare. The civilian
infection was not necessarily harmful, and does mere infection equate to an
attack in cyberspace? Whether it was harmful or not, are there expectations for
special consideration of civilians in cyberspace?\footnote{\cite{TODO}}

The stakes are far greater in the case of infected industry systems, however.
Infection at locations operating the targeted Siemens machines are subject to
the same risk and harm as the intended target, Iran.

\subsection*{Accountability}
It seems obvious that, if decided to be in violation of any laws, the sponsors
of the malware and its authors could be held responsible. There may be
additional participants to consider, though. In kinetic warfare,
belligerents cannot use neutral territory for transport of
munitions, and it is a duty of the neutral state to ensure that is the
case.\footnote{\cite{hagueConventionV5}. See Articles 2 and 5.} Is it legal
to move malware through the infrastructure of neutral states, and can those
states be held responsible for allowing it?
% Edgar suggested Hague is an outdated concept, but the Tallinn Manual itself
% quotes it (double check that)?

\subsection*{Retaliation, Defense and Rebuke}
Equally important is the issue of enforcement and reprimanding states who are
deemed in violation of any accepted law. The United Nations Charter allows for
a use of force as self defense in Article 51, but could a military response to
a computer hack be reasonable?\footnote{\cite{unCharter}. See Article 51.}

If Stuxnet or similar attacks are decided to fall short of a qualification as a
use of force can there be any retaliation taken? Particularly, what if the
victim state doesn't have the means to defend itself, yet the United Nations
doesn't deem the operation a use of force? This was the case in the 2007 attacks
Russia launched on Estonia, who suffered a completely debilitated Internet for
two weeks and received no aid after a request to the United Nations Security
Council.\footnote{\cite{TODO}} Would an external state with
sufficient capability have the United Nation's blessing to offer protection?

\section*{Using the Tallinn Manual to Analyze the Stuxnet Worm}
% Determine the applicability of Tallinn Manual to Stuxnet. Does it work?
Now we turn to the Tallinn Manual to resolve the issues applying the existing
laws to cyberspace,. We'd like to determine whether the Tallinn Manual is an
effective tool in practice by finding whether it proves useful when evaluating
Stuxnet.

Regarding legality of Stuxnet, the Tallinn Manual defines a cyber operation to
be a use of force when the
effects of the operation ``are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the
level of a use of force.''\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}} It goes on to suggest
a detailed rating scale for cyber operations in the comments, including such
factors as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness and military character,
most of which Stuxnet clearly violates.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See page
  51.} The group of experts unanimously concluded Stuxnet to be a use of force,
and therefore in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations
Charter.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetForceWired2013}} Stuxnet also directly violates
at least the sovereignty set forth in Rule 1 of the Tallinn
Manual.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 1.}

The manual goes on to say that the experts were unanimous in determining cyber
operations alone might qualify as armed
conflict.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 22, comment 15.} Tallinn
Manual states:

      \begin{quote}
        An armed conflict exists whenever there are here are hostilities, which
        may include or be limited to cyber operations, occurring between two or
        more States.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 22.}
      \end{quote}

Tallinn Manual also comments directly that the experts were divided on whether
Stuxnet qualified as an ``armed attack''.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 22, comments 14
  and 15.} Some experts felt it was justified as anticipatory
self-defense.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual} See Rule 13, comment 13.}

This finding alone is significant, because it enables retaliation under Article 51
to a cyber attack within the realm of possibility. This directly contradicts
other interpretations of the Charter that reserve an armed attack for armed
military operation.\footnote{\cite{internationalLawForCyber}}

Indiscriminate methods of cyber war are
prohibited.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 43.} The infection of
civilians' computers (might\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 1,
  comment 6.}) not violate this, because despite infection, the
attack was performed only on specific Siemens systems (not
civilian).\footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}} That is assuming, of course, the
mere installation of malware does not amount to an attack. It's not clear how
the Tallinn Manual would categorize such a thing.

If Kapersky's claims\footnote{\cite{stuxnetLeakKapersky}} that Stuxnet later
infected Russian nuclear sites are true, however, Stuxnet did violate this rule,
since Stuxnet was decidedly a cyber attack and this would prove it was not
limited in its effects as required by the law of armed
conflict.\footnote{\cite{genevaArticle51}}

There were also a number of issues on which the Tallinn Manual was not
conclusive.

As mentioned, Tallinn Manual is clear that cyber operations alone could amount
to an armed attack,\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 22.} but provide little
means to determine whether a specific operation crosses that threshold,
or how an armed attack relates to a use of force (though that is a
standing problem with kinetic warfare, just the same). Schmitt says
these specifics were intentionally not included in the
Tallinn Manual.\footnote{\cite{areThereIntlRules}}

Schmitt claimed that:
\begin{quote}
  [...]the majority said that an attack, in the law of war, means
  you physically harm someone, you break something, you cause physical
  damage or you interfere in the functionality of an object such that it
  needs to be actually repaired.\footnote{\cite{areThereIntlRules},
    para 4.}
\end{quote}

The Tallinn Manual does offer a definition for a cyber attack, which is a
``[...] cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably
expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to
objects.''\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 30.} Both Schmitt's comment
and the consensus of the legal scholars seem to suggest Stuxnet was an armed
attack, yet the experts still disagree it crossed the threshold. There was little
physical damage done, compared traditional, kinetic
force.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetArmedAttackRegister}}

There are also issues with immediacy that were not matters in kinetic
warfare. Iran didn't know it was being attacked until the threat was
over, and with no imminent or current attack there is no justification
for an armed response under Article 51.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See rule 15.}

Who can be held responsible in a cyber attack? Iran obviously had jurisdiction
in Stuxnet.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 2} What of neutral states
whose infrastructure was used to transfer Stuxnet? Laws on kinetic warfare imply
they can be held accountable for transferring munitions. The Hague Conventions
itself limits a neutral state's obligation to restrict the combatant use
of telephone or wireless cables.\footnote{\cite{hagueConventionV5}.
  See article 8.} Tallinn Manual states it must not
\emph{knowingly} allow conflicting parties to use its
infrastructure.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See rule 93.} The experts
were split on whether that permits neutral states to passively allow
such transmission.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual} See rule 93, comments 5 and 6.}

What self-defense is legal when it's unclear whether an operation
could be classified as an ``armed attack'', or when the Security Council has not
yet reached an agreement?

\section*{Adopting the Tallinn Manual}
% Proposed solution. So is it's effective, what should we do about it?
The Tallinn Manual does an outstanding job of applying existing international
law to the age of the Internet. This is a great foundation, but dealing effectively
with this era of cyber operations may require more than just translations of
laws from the kinetic era.

This paper briefly went over the 2007 conflict between Russia and
Estonia. The Tallinn Manual is unlikely to qualify that event as an armed attack,
since there was no reasonable expectation of injury, death or damage. As states
grow more dependent on cyberspace for the operation of critical infrastructure, however,
there is no longer a requirement of physical destruction or violence to threaten
a states' sovereignty. Therefore, this conclusion of the Tallinn Manual is on
that needs to catch up with the age of the Internet. Michael Norris suggests
an amendment to the definition of a cyber attack to reconcile (difference
emphasized):

\begin{quote}
  A cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is
  reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or
  destruction to, \emph{or neutralization of}, objects.\footnote{\cite{TODO http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/775/the-law-of-attack-in-cyberspace-considering-the-tallinn-manuals-definition-of-attack-in-the-digital-battlespace}}
\end{quote}

This amendment should not suggest that any disruption of service be regarded as
a cyber attack, but needs to allow for protection in cases like the attack on
Estonia, where there was a great effect on the nation's ability to operate
effectively, yet without any physical damage.

This amendment and other sections of the rule set could be seen as lacking some
detail or specifics. When does an operation cross the threshold from an
inconvenience to an attack? And is the mere installation of malware a violation of
soveriegnty? This lack of detail in the Tallinn Manual can actually be regarded
as a strength. Much of the gray area is equally undecided in kinetic conflict, terribly
complex and likely to evolve at a rapid pace. Making a set of rules as specific
and technically detailed as possible has the significant drawback of failing to
keep up with innovation and potentially allowing for legal loopholes.

Adoption of the Tallinn Manual raises more than only technical questions.
Some of the greatest hurdles to adopting the Tallinn Manual are political.
As a NATO sponsored project, the translation of existing law to
the realm of the internet may be accompanied by a Western bias. Further, those
states usually at odds with NATO will be unlikely to consider a set of rules
built solely by NATO.

Some of the currently conflicting issues (responsibility of neutral
states, whether installing malware is itself a violation of sovereignty,
etc) on which the experts were divided could be solidified with time and
applied as general rules. Those states outside NATO, particularly those often in
disagreement, should be encouraged to participate in solidifying and defining
the rule set. This will help the Tallinn Manual to 1) be free of NATO bias and
2) be supported by all states, not just those who are members of NATO.

Once the evolution of the Tallinn Manual is made a global participation it will
be more likely to garner universal backing. When it does, the current members of
the United Nations should be encouraged to sign a treaty adopting adherence to
the rules set forth by the Manual.

The treaty should adopt the Tallinn Manual as a starting point for ruling on
international cyber conflict and used as a bases to continually evolve relevant
international law, just as the United States' Constitution served as a starting
point for US law and was molded by hundreds of years of precedence.

The United Nations already has an established means to judge violations of
established agreements, and the same framework should be used for cyberspace
agreements. Violation of the Tallinn Manual should be ruled on by the United Nations
Security Council, at which point any retaliation, up to and including that under
Article 51, is a potential outcome. This is also suggested in the Tallinn
Manual itself.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 18.}

Given the rapid evolution of information technology, it should be a highest
priority to establish an official means to make lasting and binding amendments
to the Manual (or treaty), as deemed necessary by the Security Council and
members of the United Nations.

\section*{Where Adoption Brings the International Community}
The solution is neither complete nor final, but as with all law, we must
set up a solid base with which to work and progress over time. The
established international law made preparation for the age of the internet
possible, and in the same way, the Tallinn Manual sets the stage for the
tools we need in decades to come, as the world grows increasingly more
reliant on the Internet.
Schmitt implied he believes the standards for classifying armed attacks
in cyberspace will evolve in coming years:

\begin{quote}
  I anticipate that we'll see a lot of thresholds coming down that will
  allow states to respond more vibrantly to cyber attacks that  might not be
  possible under the law as we found it.\footnote{\cite{areThereIntlRules},
    para 23.}
\end{quote}

The ability of a cyber operation to be classified as an armed attack, and by
extension the possibility of responding with military force under Article 51, is
quite significant and can lead to a severe escalation during times of
conflict. This is appropriate, though, as the world's critical infrastructure
grows increasingly more online and cyber weapons increase in ability and
complexity constantly. It is an antiquated notion that military ``arms'' must
explode, shoot, or even directly cause bloodshed.

The conclusions of the Tallinn Manual feel reasonable.
Many of the issues not directly resolved are complex and likely require
analysis on a case-by-case basis. The issues that were directly resolved
are not only founded on accepted international law, but feel just when
applied to the cyber world.

Achieving concurrence on acceptable cyber acts will likely prove
challenging, but it is a necessary feature as the cyber space continues to
evolve in ways not yet considered.

Despite any unintentional bias introduced by the experts' NATO background, their
effort to apply already agreed upon international law provides confidence in the
international arena that the international community, collectively, is
continuing to act in cyber space in the spirit of previously established and
accepted international laws.

Another notable, though indirect, potential effect is the preservation of an
open internet within and among sovereign states. As the states of the world
realize the potential damage inflicted by attacks launched via cyberspace they are
taking measures to secure, regulate and police domestic networks, often at the
expense of some traditional internet freedoms.\footnote{\cite{TODO cte EFF?}}
For example, while the United States hasn't passed significant regulation on
networks and software to defend against cyber attacks, there are many arguments
to establish such proposals. Richard Clarke, a leading adviser on cyber
security in the US political space, is a proponent for greater regulations.

\begin{quote}
[...] industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If industry doesn't
respond (to the threat), you have to follow through.\footnote{\cite{TODO http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Former-White-House-aide-backs-some-Net-regulation-2729985.php}}
\end{quote}

\section*{Conclusion}
The Tallinn Manual offers help in an area which the international community much
needs it in the coming years. It should be taken advantage of.

The Tallinn Manual is not without technical and political hurdles, but it is
ultimately worthy of official acceptance in founding international
law and standards.

An agreement would not only help provide protection to the infrastructure and
sovereignty of participating states, it could encourage a continued free and
open Internet.

The international community can look forward to a healthy,
global internet with help from the Tallinn Manual and subsequent discussions on
permissible and responsible online operations and stewardship.
It is the confidence to move forward.
