\section*{Introduction}
In the wake of the Second World War, the international community recognized the
necessity of establishing agreements for international conflict.
The United Nations was organized in 1942\footnote{\cite{unitedNationsHistory}}
and the Geneva Conventions in 1949.\footnote{\cite{genevaConventionsOrigins}}
These organizations founded treaties that defined international laws for entering
into conflict (\textit{jus ad bellum}) and behavior during conflict
(\textit{jus in bello}).

The agreements established by these groups had only kinetic warfare in mind. The growing
prevalence of cyber operations is pushing the boundaries of
acceptable international behavior, and the international community has little
means to deal with it. Cyber actions rarely have a direct or obvious kinetic
counterpart with which to compare, and without established norms, states
continue to push the boundaries, limited by technical capabilities rather
than legal or ethical standards. The Tallinn Manual aims to fill the void of
defined international law or agreements when it comes to cyber
activity.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 18, para 2.}

The goal of this report is to examine whether the Tallinn Manual is
suitable for adoption in the international community by considering
its applicability to real life actions, particularly the Stuxnet worm. Its
adoption could help to ensure the safety and security of all in the coming
years.

\section*{Our Current Situation}
As aforementioned, the established international law deals only with kinetic
warfare. There is no international policy establishing how states can operate
militarily online. Differing interpretations of established laws results in dissension
among states, with no clear answers on how to classify illegal online activity,
whether it's possible to launch an armed attack in cyber
space\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}, pages 431-435.}, or whether it's the
position of the UN to interfere in the online space. %TODO cite Perry of the EFF here??

The diverged viewpoints run wide. With no consensus on what constitutes
permissible cyber activity, there can be no agreement on suitable international
laws or treaties. By extension, there are also no means to reprimand states or
enforce acceptable behavior in cyberspace. This must be overcome in order to
apply the international continuity provided by traditional agreements to the age
of the internet.

\section*{Why This Needs to Change}
States of the world are growing increasingly more reliant on the internet.
The worlds' critical infrastructure, including power grids, water treatment
operations, financial institutions and health care equipment, is growing
increasingly more reliant on the Internet. Citizens and governments rely on
these services to maintain a healthy and safe standard of living. Sometimes
critical infrastructure is connected directly to the public
Internet. This infrastructure, and by extension the cyberspace that
enables its proper operation, has a direct effect on a state's sovereignty and
deserves the same protections as the physical world surrounding. The
international community needs to establish rules protecting states' cyberspace.

\section*{The Tallinn Manual}
The Tallinn Manual was created to fill the void in international law when it
comes to cyberspace. It was the effort of an international group of experts,
upon encouragement from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to
correlate existing international laws on conflict, largely the Geneva Conventions
and United Nations Charter, to
cyberspace.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 16, para 1}

Over a period of three years, legal experts from many NATO states discussed the
complications of cyber operations and how to apply the established laws to this
new dimension. The result is a set of 25 Rules and many additional thoughts, issues
and sticking points in the form of commentary throughout the document.

\section*{The Stuxnet Worm}
Stuxnet was a cyber attack in 2010 to sabotage the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at
the Iran nuclear enrichment facility and delay Iran's potential development of
nuclear weapons.\footnote{\cite{symantecStuxnetOverview}} It did this by causing
the centrifuges that spin uranium to spin out of control and ultimately destroy
themselves.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}}
All the while, the hardware would send positive reports that
operation was going safely and as planned, so the human operators had no
indication there was an issue, much less one so dire.

Stuxnet was not only extremely technically complex, it was also extremely
expensive.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetCostComplexity}} As such, it's believed to
have been conducted by a nation-state, which qualifies it as a politically
motivated operation.

There have been many controversial cyber operations in the past decade. Stuxnet
deserves the focus when considering regulation because it offers, arguably, the
most complex situation and is the most likely candidate of a cyber-only
operation to be considered a use of force or an armed attack. Prime alternative
operations include Flame Malware\footnote{\cite{flameForbes}}
and Russia's cyber attack on Georgia.\footnote{\cite{russiaAttackGeorgiaAC}}
Flame was used for only espionage, and that is generally considered legal under
international law.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 6, comment 4.} Russia's
cyber attack on Georgia, conversely, was used to further a kinetic attack and
falls clearly into the category of armed
conflict.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 94, para 6
  and \cite{tallinnManual}, rule 20.} These conclusions are unsurprising and do
not feel controversial.

The enrichment facility at Natanz was not connected to the Internet. Despite
these precautions taken against cyber attack, it proved to still be
vulnerable. It is believed to have been initially introduced to the target
environment by an infected USB drive.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetMicroscope}. See
  page 8.} En route to its final target, though, it is unknown how many state
boundaries this cyber weapon crossed.

The damage was intended to stifle development of military operations by damaging
Iran's ability to enrich uranium.
The precise effects are unknown, as Iran refused to comment on whether it
suffered damage from Stuxnet. However, it's
widely held that their nuclear program did suffer significant setbacks, on the
order of what could have been accomplished with a kinetic
attack.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetIsis}}

As is with many worms, Stuxnet proved difficult to control. It leaked into the wild and infected
TODO potentially hundreds of thousands civilian computers and, Kapersky claimed,
even infected the Russian nuclear facilities. The distinction between civilian
and nuclear facility infection is significant here, not only due to concerns
regarding civilian targeting, but because of the nature of Stuxnet itself.
Stuxnet was designed to recognize the hardware on which it was running, and if
it wasn't on specific Siemen's PLCs it would sit dormant.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetMicroscope}. TODO}
Infected civilians would not only be unaware, they would be at no risk of danger
whatsoever. The Russian nuclear facility, however, would likely suffer grave
damage, just as Iran's facility at Natanz.

\section*{Cyber Issues Where Traditional Law is Lacking}
Stuxnet and other cyber operations are unlike any ever seen. The execution of
attacks such as Stuxnet raise many questions where guidance from a suitable guide
is desired to determine which laws were broken, how severely they were broken,
and what response might be warranted.

To start, it is not clear whether Stuxnet was illegal under international law.
To determine its legality there would need to be consensus that it did violate a
law or laws already in place. One of the foremost laws would be that set forth
by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which states:

\begin{quote}
  All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or
  use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of
  any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United
  Nations.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 11.}
\end{quote}

Stuxnet's classification as a use of force is not clear, though. A traditional
use of force involves military force, though that distinction is not defined in
the Charter.

The Stuxnet worm leaked into the wild and infected civilian devices, Kapersky even
claimed it infected Russian nuclear
facilities.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetLeakKapersky}} A failure to control weapons in
kinetic warfare is outlawed as indiscriminate, but it's not clear that's what this leak
equates to.\footnote{\cite{genevaArticle51}} The civilian infection was not
necessarily harmful, and does mere infection equate to an attack in cyberspace?

It seems obvious that, if decided to be in violation of any laws, the sponsors
of the malware and its authors could be held responsible. There may be
additional participants to consider, though. In kinetic warfare,
belligerents cannot use neutral territory for transport of
munitions, and it is a duty of the neutral state to ensure that is the
case.\footnote{\cite{hagueConventionV5}. See Articles 2 and 5.} Is it legal
to move malware through the infrastructure of neutral states, and can those
states be held responsible for allowing it?

Equally important is the issue of enforcement and reprimanding states who are
deemed in violation of any accepted law. The UN Charter allows for a use of
force as self defense in Article 51, but could a military response to
a computer hack be reasonable?\footnote{\cite{unCharter}. See Article 51.}

\section*{Applying the Tallinn Manual to the Stuxnet Worm}
  % Determine the applicability of Tallinn Manual to Stuxnet. Does it work?
Now that there have been sufficient, specific issues raised with the
applicability of existing law to cyberspace we turn to the Tallinn Manual to
help. We'd like to determine whether the Tallinn Manual is an effective tool in
practice by finding whether it proves useful when evaluating Stuxnet.

Regarding legality of Stuxnet, the Tallinn Manual defines a cyber operation to
be a use of force when the
effects of the operation ``are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the
level of a use of force.''\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}} It goes on to suggest
a detailed rating scale for cyber operations in the comments, including such
factors as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness and military character,
most of which Stuxnet clearly violates.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See page
  51.} The group of experts unanimously concluded Stuxnet to be a use of force,
and therefore in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN
Charter.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetForceWired2013}} Stuxnet also directly violates
at least Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 1.}

The manual goes on to say
that the experts were unanimous in determining cyber operations alone might
qualify as armed conflict.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 22, comment
  15.} Tallinn Manual states:

      \begin{quote}
        An armed conflict exists whenever there are here are hostilities, which
        may include or be limited to cyber operations, occurring between two or
        more States.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 22.}
      \end{quote}

This finding alone is significant, because it enables retaliation under Article 51
to a cyber attack within the realm of possibility. This directly contradicts
other interpretations of the Charter that reserve an armed attack for armed military
operation.\footnote{\cite{TODO that paper you downloaded from
    http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1083889}}

Tallinn Manual also comments directly that the experts were divided on whether
Stuxnet qualified as an ``armed attack''.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 22, comments 14
  and 15.} Some experts felt it was justified as anticipatory
self-defense.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual} See Rule 13, comment 13.}

Indiscriminate methods of cyber war are
prohibited.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 43.} The infection of
civilians' computers (might\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 1,
  comment 6.}) not violate this, because despite infection, the
attack was performed only on specific Siemens systems (not
civilian).\footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}} That is assuming, of course, the
mere installation of malware does not amount to an attack. It's not clear how
the Tallinn Manual would categorize such a thing.

If Kapersky's claims\footnote{\cite{stuxnetLeakKapersky}} that Stuxnet later
infected Russian nuclear sites are true, however, Stuxnet did violate this rule,
since Stuxnet was decidedly a cyber attack and this would prove it was not
limited in its effects as required by the law of armed
conflict.\footnote{\cite{genevaArticle51}}

Issues on which the Tallinn Manual was not conclusive. What self-defense is
legal when it's unclear whether an operation could be classified as an
``armed attack'', or when the Security Council has not yet reached an agreement?

How might we determine what constitutes an armed cyber attack? Some states
adopt a broad view of what constitutes illegal force, while others have developed
a much narrower classification.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 17, para 3.}

As mentioned, Tallinn Manual is clear that cyber operations alone could amount to an armed
attack,\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 22.} but provide little means to
determine whether a specific operation crosses that threshold,
or how an armed attack relates to a use of force (though that is a
standing problem with kinetic warfare, just the same). Schmitt says
these specifics were intentionally not included in the
Tallinn Manual.\footnote{\cite{areThereIntlRules}}

If we can assume an armed attack accompanies any use of force and
warrants a response under Article 51 (similar to the apparent view of
the United States (US)\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}.
  See page 433, para 4.}), then the Tallinn Manual provides a
fairly complete template to determine whether an operation
qualifies.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See rule 11, esp. comment 9.}

Schmitt claimed that:
\begin{quote}
  [...]the majority said that an attack, in the law of war, means
  you physically harm someone, you break something, you cause physical
  damage or you interfere in the functionality of an object such that it
  needs to be actually repaired.\footnote{\cite{areThereIntlRules},
    para 4.}
\end{quote}

This seems to qualify Stuxnet as an armed attack, yet other experts
still disagreed it crossed the undefined threshold. There was little
physical damage done, compared traditional, kinetic
force.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetArmedAttackRegister}}
There are also issues with immediacy that were not matters in kinetic
warfare. Iran didn't know it was being attacked until the threat was
over, and with no imminent or current attack there is no justification
for an armed response under Article 51.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See rule 15.}

Who can be held responsible in a cyber attack? Iran obviously had jurisdiction
in Stuxnet.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See Rule 2} Attribution is still a
significant challenge though.

What of neutral states whose infrastructure was used to transfer
Stuxnet? Laws on kinetic warfare imply they can be held accountable for
transferring munitions. The Hague Conventions
itself limits a neutral state's obligation to restrict the combatant use
of telephone or wireless cables.\footnote{\cite{hagueConventionV5}.
  See article 8.} Tallinn Manual states it must not
\emph{knowingly} allow conflicting parties to use its
infrastructure.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}. See rule 93.} The experts
were split on whether that permits neutral states to passively allow
such transmission.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual} See rule 93, comments 5 and 6.}

\section*{Adopting the Tallinn Manual}
  % Proposed solution. So is it's effective, what should we do about it?
Proposed solution for resolving international cyber conflict.
The Tallinn Manual does an outstanding job of applying existing
international law to the age of the internet, albeit lacking some
detail. Much of the gray area is equally undecided in kinetic
conflict, terribly complex and likely to evolve at a rapid pace.
The Tallinn Manual should be adopted as a starting point for ruling on
international cyber conflict and used to evolve international law, just as
the US Constitution served as a starting point for US law and was molded
by hundreds of years of precedence.

Adoption of the Tallinn Manual raises more than only technical questions.
Some of the greatest hurdles to adopting the Tallinn Manual are political.
As a NATO sponsored project, the translation of existing law to
the realm of the internet may be accompanied by a Western bias. Further, those
states usually at odds with NATO will be unlikely to consider a set of rules
built solely by NATO.

Some of the currently conflicting issues (responsibility of neutral
states, whether installing malware is itself a violation of sovereignty,
etc) on which the experts were divided could be solidified with time and
applied as general rules. Those states outside NATO, particularly those often in
disagreement, should be encouraged to participate in solidifying and defining
the rule set. This will help the Tallinn Manual to 1) be free of NATO bias and
2) be supported by all states, not just those who are members of NATO.

Once the evolution of the Tallinn Manual is made a global participation, the
current members of the UN should be encouraged to sign a treaty
adopting adherence to the rules it defines. This is the ultimate goal.

Violation of the Tallinn Manual should be ruled on by the UN Security
Council, at which point any retaliation, up to and including that under
Article 51, is a potential outcome. This is also suggested in the Tallinn
Manual itself.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 18.}

There should be an official means to make lasting and binding amendments
to the Manual (or treaty), as deemed necessary by the Security Council and
members of the UN.

\section*{Where Adoption Brings International Cyber Space}
Analysis of the solution.
The solution is neither complete nor final, but as with all law, we must
set up a solid base with which to work and progress over time. The
established international law made preparation for the age of the internet
possible, and in the same way, the Tallinn Manual sets the stage for the
tools we need in decades to come, as the world grows increasingly more
reliant on the Internet.
Schmitt implied he believes the standards for classifying armed attacks
in cyberspace will evolve in coming years:

\begin{quote}
  I anticipate that we'll see a lot of thresholds coming down that will
  allow states to respond more vibrantly to cyber attacks that  might not be
  possible under the law as we found it.\footnote{\cite{areThereIntlRules},
    para 23.}
\end{quote}

The ability of a cyber operation to be classified as an armed attack, and by
extension the possibility of responding with military force under Article 51, is
quite significant and can lead to a severe escalation during times of
conflict. This is appropriate, though, as the world's critical infrastructure
grows increasingly more online and cyber weapons increase in ability and
complexity constantly. It is an antiquated notion that military ``arms'' must
explode, shoot, or even directly cause bloodshed.

The conclusions of the Tallinn Manual feel reasonable.
Many of the issues not directly resolved are complex and likely require
analysis on a case-by-case basis. The issues that were directly resolved
are not only founded on accepted international law, but feel just when
applied to the cyber world.

Achieving concurrence on acceptable cyber acts will likely prove
challenging, but it is a necessary feature as the cyber space continues to
evolve in ways not yet considered.

\section*{Conclusion}
Conclusion
The Tallinn Manual offers help in an area which the international community much
needs it in the coming years. It should be taken advantage of.

The Tallinn Manual is worthy of official acceptance in founding international
law and standards. The international community can look forward to a healthy,
global internet with help from the Tallinn Manual and subsequent discussions on
permissible and responsible online operations and stewardship.
The efforts of the Tallinn Manual will give us confidence in the
international arena that we, collectively, are continuing to act in cyber
space in the spirit of already established and accepted international laws.
It is the confidence to move forward.
