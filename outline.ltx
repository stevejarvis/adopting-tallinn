\begin{outline}
  \1 Introduction.
    \2 In a world growing progressively more online, international law currently
    has a limited means for ruling on criminal cyber action.
      \3 The United Nations Charter and Geneva Conventions deal, historically,
      with only kinetic warfare. Cyber actions rarely have a direct or obvious
      kinetic counterpart with which to compare. This results in dissension
      among states.
        \4 Some states adopt a broad view of what constitutes illegal
        force while others have developed a much more exclusive
        classification.\footnote{Tallinn Manual, page 17 para 3.}
        \4 With no consensus on what constitutes illegal cyber activity, there
        can be no agreement on suitable international laws.
    \2 The Tallinn Manual aims to fill the void of defined international law
    when it comes to cyber activity. \footnote{Tallinn Manual, page 18 para 2.}
      \3 With the help of an international panel of experts.

  \1 Challenges. Determine whether the Tallinn Manual is an effective
  tool beyond theoretical. Whether it retains usefulness when applied to
  a real life attack.
    \2 Consider, specifically, the actions and consequences of the Flame
    Malware.\footnote{Forbes intro to Flame.}
      \3 Explain Flame technically, briefly.
        \4 What were the goals and how did it accomplish them.
      \3 What Flame accomplished.
        \4 International boundaries crossed.\footnote{\cite{aardvark2013china}}
        \4 Interaction between governments and corporations.
        \4 How it effected civilians.

  \1 Description of policy framework as relevant to this problem.
    \2 The existing, official framework.
      \3 United Nations Security Council and the Geneva Convention.
        \4 Where the existing frameworks are effective.
        \4 Where it's laws, regulations, and governing bodies fall short.
    \2 Decide whether the (unofficial) Tallinn Manual is relevant or useful
      in making such determinations.
      \3 Where it met or exceeded the needs of an international cyber
      conflict doctrine.
      \3 Where the Tallinn Manual fell short or failed to be applicable.

  \1 Proposed solution for resolving international cyber conflict.
    \2 Was it effective? The ability to apply the Tallinn Manual to cyber
    activity.
      \3 If it is possible to apply as an extension of Jus Ad Bellum or Jus In
      Bello.

  \1 Analysis of the solution.
    \2 Whether it will be effective.

  \1 Conclusion
