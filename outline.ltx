\begin{outline}
  \1 Introduction. A brief introduction stating the intentions and motivations
  of this paper.
    \2 Goal is to determine whether Flame Malware violated international law.
    \2 Describe the limited means the international community has for ruling on
    and upholding convictions in cyber law.
      \3 UN Charter (Jus Ad Bellum) and Geneva Convention (Jus In Bello) deal,
      historically, with only kinetic warfare. It is difficult to apply old
      rules to a new world.
    \2 Explain the efforts and effects thus far of Tallinn Manual.

  \1 Challenges. Attempt to determine whether international law was broken by
  the actions of the Flame Malware.
    \2 Decide whether the Tallinn Manual is relevant or useful in making such
    determinations.
      \3 Where it met or exceeded the needs of an international cyber
      conflict doctrine.
      \3 Where the Tallinn Manual fell short or failed to be applicable.

  \1 Description of policy framework.
    \2 The existing framework.
      \3 United Nations Security Council and the Geneva Convention.
      \3 The (unofficial) Tallinn Manual.

  \1 Proposed solution for resolving international cyber conflict.
    \2 The ability to apply the Tallinn Manual to cyber activity.
      \3 If it is possible to apply as an extension of Jus Ad Bellum or Jus In
      Bello.

  \1 Analysis of the solution.
    \2 Whether it will be effective.

  \1 Conclusion
