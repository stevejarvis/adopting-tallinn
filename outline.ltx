% The body of the outline
\begin{outline}
  \1 Introduction.
    \2 In a world growing progressively more online, international law currently
    has a limited means for ruling on criminal cyber action.
      \3 The United Nations Charter and Geneva Conventions deal, historically,
      with only kinetic warfare.
        \4 Cyber actions rarely have a direct or obvious
        kinetic counterpart with which to compare. This results in dissension
        among states, with no clear answers on how to classify a use of force or
        armed attack online, or even whether it's possible to launch an armed
        attack in cyber space.\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}, pages 431-435}
        \4 Some states adopt a broad view of what constitutes illegal
        force while others have developed a much more exclusive
        classification.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 17, para 3}
        \4 With no consensus on what constitutes illegal cyber activity, there
        can be no agreement on suitable international laws.
    \2 The Tallinn Manual aims to fill the void of defined international law
    when it comes to cyber activity. \footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page
      18, para 2}
      \3 The Tallinn Manual was the effort of an international group of experts,
      upon encouragement from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
      (NATO).\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 16, para 1}

  \1 Challenges. Determine whether the Tallinn Manual is an effective
  tool beyond a theoretical use. Whether it retains usefulness when applied to
  a real life attack.
    \2 Consider, specifically, the actions and consequences of the Stuxnet
    Worm. Determine whether international law was broken, and if so, how
    severely.
      \3 Explain Stuxnet technically, briefly.
        \4 It was an attack to sabotage the programmable logic controllers
        (PLCs) at the Iran nuclear enrichment facility and significantly delay
        Iran's potential development of nuclear weapons.\footnote{\cite{symantecStuxnetOverview}}
        \4 Stuxnet was not only extremely technically complex, it was also
        extremely expensive.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetCostComplexity}}
      \3 Why Stuxnet deserves the focus.
        \4 Prime alternatives are Flame Malware\footnote{\cite{flameForbes2013}}
        and Russia's cyber attack on
        Georgia.\footnote{\cite{russiaAttackGeorgiaAC}}
        Flame was used for only espionage, and that is generally considered
        legal under international
        law.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 6, comment 4.} Russia's cyber
        attack on Georgia, conversely, was used to further a kinetic attack and
        falls clearly into the category of armed
        conflict.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 94, para 6 and
          \cite{tallinnManual}, rule 20.} These conclusions are unsurprising and
        do not feel controversial.
      \3 What were Stuxnet's goals and what it accomplished.
        \4 Cause damage to and slow development of Iran's nuclear
        development.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}}
        \4 Iran refused to comment on whether it suffered damage from
        Stuxnet. Other reports conclude that their nuclear program likely
        did suffer significant setbacks.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetIsis}}
      \3 Legal issues related to Stuxnet, on which guidance is desired from the
      Tallinn Manual.
        \4 Intentional damage caused to a sovereign state's infrastructure. Was
        it illegal, a use of force, and/or armed?
        \4 The damage was intended to stifle development of military operations.
        \4 How severe of a response is warranted?
        \4 The worm leaked into the wild and civilians, Kapersky even claimed
        it's infected Russian nuclear
        facilities.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetLeakKapersky}}

  \1 Description of Tallinn Manual as relevant to a real life problem.
    \2 Where the Tallinn Manual meets the needs of an international
    cyber conflict doctrine in the case of Stuxnet.
      % Remember, an armed attack exceeds a use of force.
      \3 Unanimously determined to be in violation of international law and a
      use of force by the group of
      experts.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetForceWired2013}}
      \3 The manual goes on to say that the experts were unanimous in
      determining cyber operations alone might qualify as armed
      conflict.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 22, comment 15.} Tallinn
      Manual states:
      \begin{quote}
        An armed conflict exists whenever there are here are hostilities, which
        may include or be limited to cyber operations, occurring between two or
        more States.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 22.}
      \end{quote}
        \4 Tallinn Manual also comments directly that the experts were divided on
      whether Stuxnet qualified as an
      ``armed attack''.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 22, comments 14 and
        15.} Some experts felt it was justified as anticipatory
        self-defense.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 13, comment 13.}
      \3 Indiscriminate methods of cyber war are
      prohibited.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 43.} The infection of
      civilians' computers does not violate this, because despite infection, the
      attack was performed only on specific Siemens
      systems (not civilian).\footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}}
        \4 If Kapersky's claims that Stuxnet later infected Russian nuclear
        sites are true, however, Stuxnet did violate this rule, since it proves
        it was not limited in its effects as required by the law of armed
        conflict.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetLeakKapersky} and
          \cite{genevaArticle51}}
    \2 Issues on which the Tallinn Manual was not conclusive.
      \3 Who even gets to accuse a suspect? Who gets to persecute?
        \4 Tallinn Manual doesn't seem to mention a requirement of cyber
        combatants to identify themselves, and it's seems unlikely they would,
        anyway. Attribution is a big challenge.
      \3 How might we determine what constitutes an armed cyber attack?
        \4 Tallinn Manual is clear that cyber operations could amount to an
        armed attack,\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 22.} but provide no
        means to determine whether a specific operation crosses that threshold,
        or how an armed attack relates to a use of force (though that is a
        standing problem with kinetic warfare, just the same.)

  \1 Proposed solution for resolving international cyber conflict.
    \2 The Tallinn Manual does an outstanding job of applying existing
    international law to the age of the internet, albeit lacking some
    defining detail. Without application to real life international conflict,
    though, it isn't obvious the Manual could reasonably be made much more
    detailed.
      \3 For example, there is little guidance on determining if Stuxnet,
      or any operation, qualifies as an armed attack. Some views, seemingly
      including that of the United States,\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}, page
      433, para 4.} suggest that a use of force and an armed attack may be one
      in the same online.
        \4 Even though one in the same, the US has a relatively specific
        definition of a ``use of force''.
        \4 If we can assume an armed attack accompanies any use of force and
        warrants a response under Article 51, then the Tallinn Manual provides a
        fairly complete template to determine whether an operation
        qualifies.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 11, particularly comment
          9.}
        \4 TODO find out why they thought it was an armed attack.
    \2 The Tallinn Manual should be adopted as a starting point for ruling on
    international cyber conflict and used to evolve international law, just as
    the U.S. Constitution served as a starting point and was molded by hundreds
    of years of precedence.
    \2 The current members of the UN should be encouraged to sign a treaty
    adopting adherence to the Manual.
    \2 Violation of the Tallinn Manual should be ruled on by the UN Security
    Council, at which point any retaliation, up to and including that under
    Article 51, is a potential outcome.
    \2 There should be an official means to make amendments to the Manual, as
    necessary.

  \1 Analysis of the solution.
    \2 The solution is neither perfect nor final, but as with all law, we must
    set up a solid base with which to work and progress over time. The
    established international law made preparation for the age of the internet
    possible, and the Tallinn Manual offers that help. In the same way, the
    Tallinn Manual sets the stage for the tools we need in decades to come, as
    the world grows increasingly more reliant on the internet.
    \2 Ratifying additional amendments will likely always prove challenging,
    just as international concurrence tends to be, but it is still an important
    necessity as the cyber space continues to evolve in ways not yet considered.

  \1 Conclusion
    \2 Manual needs refinement and official acceptance, but is a tool worthy of
    forming international law.
    \2 The efforts of the Tallinn Manual will give us confidence in the
    international arena that we, collectively, are continuing to act in cyber
    space in the spirit of already established and accepted laws.
