% The body of the outline
\begin{outline}
  \1 Introduction.
    \2 In a world growing progressively more online, international law currently
    has a limited means for ruling on criminal cyber action.
      \3 The United Nations Charter and Geneva Conventions deal, historically,
      with only kinetic warfare.
        \4 Cyber actions rarely have a direct or obvious
        kinetic counterpart with which to compare. This results in dissension
        among states, with no clear answers on how to classify a use of force or
        armed attack online, or even whether it's possible to launch an armed
        attack in cyber space.\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}, pages 431-435}
        \4 Some states adopt a broad view of what constitutes illegal
        force while others have developed a much more exclusive
        classification.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 17, para 3}
        \4 With no consensus on what constitutes illegal cyber activity, there
        can be no agreement on suitable international laws.
    \2 The Tallinn Manual aims to fill the void of defined international law
    when it comes to cyber activity. \footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page
      18, para 2}
      \3 The Tallinn Manual was the effort of an international group of experts,
      upon encouragement from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
      (NATO).\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 16, para 1}

  \1 Challenges. Determine whether the Tallinn Manual is an effective
  tool beyond a theoretical use. Whether it retains usefulness when applied to
  a real life attack.
    \2 Consider, specifically, the actions and consequences of the Stuxnet
    Worm. Determine whether international law was broken, and if so, how
    severely.
      \3 Explain Stuxnet technically, briefly.
        \4 It was an attack to sabotage the programmable logic controllers
        (PLCs) at the Iran nuclear enrichment facility and significantly delay
        Iran's potential development of nuclear weapons.\footnote{\cite{symantecStuxnetOverview}}
        \4 Stuxnet was only extremely technically complex, extremely
        expensive.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetCostComplexity}}
      \3 Why Stuxnet?
        \4 Prime alternatives are Flame Malware\footnote{\cite{flameForbes2013}}
        and Russia's cyber attack on
        Georgia.\footnote{\cite{russiaAttackGeorgiaAC}}
        Flame was used for only espionage, and that is generally considered
        legal under international
        law.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, rule 6, comment 4.} Russia's cyber
        attack on Georgia, conversely, was used to further a kinetic attack and
        falls clearly into the category of armed
        conflict.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual}, page 94, para 6 and
          \cite{tallinnManual}, rule 20.} These conclusions are unsurprising and
        do not feel controversial.
      \3 What were Stuxnet's goals and what it accomplished.
        \4 Cause damage to and slow development of Iran's nuclear
        development.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetGoalResult}}
        \4 Iran refused to comment on whether it suffered damage from
        Stuxnet. Other reports conclude that their nuclear program likely
        did suffer significant setbacks.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetIsis}}
      \3 Legal issues related to Stuxnet, on which guidance is desired from the
      Tallinn Manual.
        \4 Intentional damage caused to a sovereign state's infrastructure.
        \4 The damage was intended to stifle development of military operations.
        \4 The worm leaked into the wild and civilians, Kapersky even claimed
        it's infected Russian nuclear
        facilities.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetLeakKapersky}}

  \1 Description of Tallinn Manual as relevant to this problem. Decide whether
  the Tallinn Manual is relevant or useful in making such determinations.
    \2 Where the Tallinn Manual met or exceeded the needs of an international
    cyber conflict doctrine in the case of Stuxnet.
      % Remember, an armed attack exceeds a use of force.
      \3 Unanimously determined to be in violation of international law and a
      use of force by the group of
      experts.\footnote{\cite{stuxnetForceWired2013}}
    \2 Where the Tallinn Manual fell short or failed to be applicable.
      \3 Who gets to persecute? Who even gets to accuse a suspect?
      \3 How might we determine what constitutes an armed cyber attack?
      \3 Is it even possible to have a ``armed'' cyber attack?

  \1 TODO Proposed solution for resolving international cyber conflict.
    \2 Was it effective? The ability to apply the Tallinn Manual to cyber
    activity.
      \3 If it is possible to apply as an extension of Jus Ad Bellum or Jus In
      Bello.

  \1 TODO Analysis of the solution.
    \2 Whether it will be effective.

  \1 TODO Conclusion
