\begin{outline}
  \1 Introduction.
    \2 In a world growing progressively more online, international law currently
    has a limited means for ruling on criminal cyber action.
      \3 The United Nations Charter and Geneva Conventions deal, historically,
      with only kinetic warfare.
        \4 Cyber actions rarely have a direct or obvious
        kinetic counterpart with which to compare. This results in dissension
        among states, with no clear answers on how to classify a use of force or
        armed attack online, or even whether it's possible to launch an armed
        attack in cyber space.\footnote{\cite{cyberAttacksYale}, pages 431-435}
        \4 Some states adopt a broad view of what constitutes illegal
        force while others have developed a much more exclusive
        classification.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual2013}, page 17, para 3}
        \4 With no consensus on what constitutes illegal cyber activity, there
        can be no agreement on suitable international laws.
    \2 The Tallinn Manual aims to fill the void of defined international law
    when it comes to cyber activity. \footnote{\cite{tallinnManual2013}, page
      18, para 2}

  \1 Challenges. Determine whether the Tallinn Manual is an effective
  tool beyond a theoretical use. Whether it retains usefulness when applied to
  a real life attack.
    \2 Consider, specifically, the actions and consequences of the Flame
    Malware.\footnote{\cite{flameForbes2012}}
      \3 Explain Flame technically, briefly.
        \4 It was an attack that allowed the attacker to impersonate a Microsoft
        server, letting the attacker distribute malware using the Windows update
        service.\footnote{\cite{TODO flamedetails}}
        \4 Not only extremely technically complex, extremely
        expensive.\footnote{\cite{flameForbes2012}}
      \3 What were Flame's goals and what it accomplished.
      \3 Legal issues related to Flame.
        \4 International boundaries crossed.
        \4 Believed interaction between U.S. government and
        U.S. corporation.\footnote{\cite{TODO flamepolitical}}
        \4 How it effected civilians.

  \1 Description of policy framework as relevant to this problem.
    \2 The existing, official framework includes the United Nations Security
    Council and the Geneva Convention.
      \3 Effectiveness of traditional means.
        \4 Well established and high participation. For states to obey the laws
        they have to accept them, and the UN is more accepted than any national
        body.\footnote{\cite{TODO}}
      \3 Where it's laws, regulations, and governing bodies fall short.
        \4 Security council deadlock negates most usefulness.
    \2 Decide whether the Tallinn Manual is relevant or useful in making such
    determinations.
      \3 The Tallinn Manual was the effort of an international group of experts,
      upon encouragement from NATO.\footnote{\cite{tallinnManual2013}, page 16,
      para 1}
      \3 Where the Tallinn Manual met or exceeded the needs of an international
      cyber conflict doctrine in the case of Flame.
        \4 TODO To what end? Military? Political??
        \4 Greatly effected civilians.
      \3 Where the Tallinn Manual fell short or failed to be applicable.
        \4 Who gets to persecute? Who even gets to accuse a suspect?

  \1 TODO Proposed solution for resolving international cyber conflict.
    \2 Was it effective? The ability to apply the Tallinn Manual to cyber
    activity.
      \3 If it is possible to apply as an extension of Jus Ad Bellum or Jus In
      Bello.

  \1 TODO Analysis of the solution.
    \2 Whether it will be effective.

  \1 TODO Conclusion
